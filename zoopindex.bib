	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

Latitudinal variation in long term trends and seasonal patterns for the two copepod species were examined for four sub-regions: the Gulf of Maine (GOM), Georges Bank (GB), Southern New England (SNE), and Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB). Results suggested that there was significant difference in long term variation between northern region (GOM and GB), and the MAB for both species. C. finmarchicus generally peaked in May – June throughout the entire study region and Cen. typicus had a more complex seasonal pattern. Time series analysis revealed that the peak time for Cen. typicus switched from November – December to January - March after 1985 in the MAB. The long term abundance of C. finmarchicus showed more fluctuation in the MAB than the GOM and GB, whereas the long term abundance of Cen. typicus was more variable in the GB than other sub-regions. Alongshore transport was significantly correlated with the abundance of C. finmarchicus, i.e., more water from north, higher abundance for C. finmarchicus. The abundance of Cen. typicus showed positive relationship with the Gulf Stream north wall index (GSNWI) in the GOM and GB, but the GSNWI only explained 12–15\% of variation in Cen. typicus abundance. In general, the alongshore current was negatively correlated with the GSNWI, suggesting that Cen. typicus is more abundant when advection from the north is less. However, the relationship between Cen. typicus and alongshore transport was not significant. The present study highlights the importance of spatial scales in the study of marine populations: observed long term changes in the northern region were different from the south for both species.},

Our cross ecoregion analysis shows that regime shifts in different ecoregions often exhibited very distinct characteristics, emphasizing more granular ﬂuctuations in NES plankton communities relative to previous work. Shifts early in the time series generally reﬂected an increase in abundance levels. The response of zooplankton abundance within fall communities was more similar among ecoregions than for spring communities. The Gulf of Maine exhibited highly distinct patterns from other ecoregions, with regime shifts identiﬁed in the early 1980s, early 2000s, and mid-2000s for spring communities. Regime shifts were identiﬁed in the early to mid-1990s for the NES, Georges Bank, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight ecoregions, while the fall communities experienced shifts in the early 1990s and late 1980s for the NES and Georges Bank, but in the late 1990s in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. A constrained correspondence analysis of zooplankton community against local and basin-scale climatological indices suggests that water temperature, stratiﬁcation, and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) were the predominant factors in driving the zooplankton community composition.},

We analyzed time series from 1977 to 2016 in GoM–GBK, 1982 to 2016 in southwest GSL and 1999 to 2016 in remaining areas. Calanus finmarchicus dominated abundance and biomass, except in the GSL where Calanus hyperboreus was abundant. The biomass of Calanus spp. declined in many subregions over years 1999–2016 and was negatively correlated with sea surface temperature in GoM–GBK and on the SS. We detected ``regime shifts” to lower biomass of Calanus spp. in the GoM–GBK in 2010 and on the SS in 2011. In the GoM–GBK, shifts to lower biomass of C. finmarchicus coincided with shifts to warmer ocean temperature and with published reports of changes in spatial distribution and reduced calving rate of NARW. We hypothesize that warming has negatively impacted population levels of Calanus spp. near their southern range limit, reducing the availability of prey to NARW.},

Striped bass YOY recruitment levels varied {\textgreater}11-fold in the 6 years examined. In those years, mean daily freshwater flows from the Susquehanna River to the bay in March and April varied {\textgreater}2-fold and controlled distribution and apparent survival of striped bass larvae. Strong recruitments of YOY striped bass were associated with matches in space and time of larval striped bass and high concentrations of zooplankton prey, especially the copepod Eurytemora affinis and cladoceran Bosmina longirostris. The strongest year classes (1996, 2003) were produced in years of high freshwater flow, characterized by a high abundance of feeding-stage larvae and a spatio-temporal match between peak abundance of larvae and zooplankton prey. Enhanced feeding opportunities were most pronounced in high freshwater-flow years (1996, 1998, 2003), when larvae and zooplankton prey were strongly associated with, and apparently retained near, the estuarine turbidity maximum. First-feeding larvae fed more successfully in a high-flow year (2003; prey incidence 91\%) than in a drier year (2001; prey incidence 35\%). A regression model that may have forecasting potential was developed to describe recruitment of YOY striped bass for the years from 1985 to 2006. The model includes spring freshwater flow and air temperatures to predict age-0 striped bass recruitment strength (R² = 0.65). Flow and temperature control environmental and hydrographic conditions that strongly influence spatio-temporal overlap of larval striped bass and zooplankton. The model provided accurate recruitment forecasts for 2007 and 2009, but was less successful in 2008, a year of exceptionally low recruitment.},

However, diet-based biomass indices may be sensitive to underlying ecological dynamics between predators and prey, such as predator functional responses and changes in overlap in space and time. To evaluate these factors, we fit spatio-temporal models to stomach contents of five Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) predators and survey catch data for predators and Atlantic herring. We identified drivers of variation in stomach contents, evaluated spatial patterns in stomach content data, and produced predator-specific indices of seasonal Atlantic herring biomass. After controlling for spatio-temporal processes and predator length, diet-based indices of biomass shared similar decadal trends but varied substantially between predators and seasons on shorter time scales. Diet-based indices reflected prey biomass more than prey availability, but weak correlations indicated that not all biological processes were controlled for. Results provide potential guidance for developing diet-based biomass indices and contribute to a body of evidence demonstrating the utility of predator diet data to provide information about relative prey biomass.},

	abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. “joint species distribution” or “multispecies occupancy” models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed “biogenic habitat”) improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

Here, we analyzed stock assessment output and survey data to test for regimes in the recruitment success of 18 commercially important marine species over a 29 yr timespan. We then tested whether recruitment regimes coincide with regimes in the zooplankton community, and whether the abundance of large spawners could explain the patterns in recruitment. We found evidence for 3 decadal-scale recruitment regimes: low recruitment success in the 1980s, high success in the 1990s, and a return to low recruitment success in the 2000s. This general pattern was found in all datasets of recruitment. The abundance of large spawners did not appear to be a broad-scale driver of recruitment success; however, recruitment regimes coincided with regimes in copepod abundance and size structure.},

	abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest (“derived quantities”) are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional “plug-in” estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new “epsilon” estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.},

	abstract = {Delta-models (a.k.a. hurdle models) are widely used to fit biomass samples that include zeros and a skewed response for positive catches, and spatio-temporal extensions of these models are increasingly used to quantify trends in abundance (i.e., estimate abundance indices). Previous research has shown estimated indices are proportional to changes in abundance. However, little research has tested the performance of delta-models for estimating “scale”; that is, whether abundance indices are not just proportional to population changes but also have the correct absolute value. We use data for twenty species in the eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska as well as a factorial experiment conditioned on data for Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod to support five conclusions related to scale in spatio-temporal delta-models. First, we show that conventional (nonspatial) delta-models are surprisingly sensitive to the a priori choice of probability distribution for positive catches, where gamma and Tweedie models give similar scale estimates but other distributions generally differ. Second, these same distri­ butions also estimate widely different scales when using spatio-temporal delta-models, and the delta-gamma and Tweedie models provide similar scale to design-based indices. Third, model selection using marginal AIC often identifies the lognormal distribution as most parsimonious, despite it resulting in systematically higher abun­ dance than design-based indices for many species. Fourth, scale is sensitive to the spatial resolution (i.e., number of knots) used in fitting the spatio-temporal model when using a naïve “empirical Bayes” estimator, but less sensitive when applying an epsilon bias-correction estimator. Fifth, the factorial simulation experiment suggests that the Tweedie and delta-gamma distributions perform well even when applied to data simulated from an inverse-Gaussian or lognormal distribution, whereas the opposite is not true. We conclude that index scale is sensitive to delta-model specification, and we make five recommendations when using spatio-temporal deltamodels for index standardization: (1) apply the epsilon or other bias-correction methods to reduce sensitivity of index scale on spatio-temporal model resolution; either (2) compare the scale of delta-model indices with that of design-based indices when design-based indices are available or (3) use the delta-gamma or Tweedie distribution by default when design-based indices are not available; (4) do not assume that AIC will identify the model specification that results in the most appropriate scale; and (5) consider apparent mismatches in index scale depending upon whether an assessment model specifies or estimates the associated catchability coefficient and whether the design-based index is believed to measure total abundance for a fully-selected age or length-class.},

	abstract = {Ecological dynamics are tremendously complicated and are studied at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Ecologists often simplify analysis by describing changes in density of individuals across a landscape, and statistical methods are advancing rapidly for studying spatio-temporal dynamics. However, spatio-temporal statistics is often presented using a set of principles that may seem very distant from ecological theory or practice. This book seeks to introduce a minimal set of principles and numerical techniques for spatio-temporal statistics that can be used to implement a wide range of real-world ecological analyses regarding animal movement, population dynamics, community composition, causal attribution, and spatial dynamics. We provide a step-by-step illustration of techniques that combine core spatial-analysis packages in R with low-level computation using Template Model Builder. Techniques are showcased using real-world data from varied ecological systems, providing a toolset for hierarchical modelling of spatio-temporal processes. Spatio-Temporal Models for Ecologists is meant for graduate level students, alongside applied and academic ecologists.
Key Features:

Foundational ecological principles and analyses
Thoughtful and thorough ecological examples
Analyses conducted using a minimal toolbox and fast computation
Code using R and TMB included in the book and available online},

Development of long-term larval indices for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) on the northeast US continental shelf. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 617–627.The incorporation of data from ichthyoplankton programmes into the stock assessment process has lagged far behind the use of data from comparable adult-monitoring programmes. This can in part be attributed to a mismatch between established analytical approaches to larval-index development and the inconsistencies in sampling for many long-term ichthyoplankton datasets. Along the northeast US continental shelf, ichthyoplankton surveys have been carried out by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NMFS/NOAA) multiple times annually since 1971, but the spatial and seasonal allocation of sampling has varied substantially. Here, we present a non-linear least-squares approach to larval-index development. We use the age structure and abundance of larvae on each survey to derive the larval index, along with parameters describing the survival of larvae and the seasonal cycle of hatching. Application to Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) revealed a large drop in the index around 1976, an increase in the index through the late 1980s, and another large drop in 2004. This index was correlated with the stock assessment estimate of Atlantic herring spawning-stock biomass from 1971 to 2003, but differed substantially during 2004. Our results demonstrate that our approach to larval-index development is flexible to the inconsistencies in sampling effort.},

Zooplankton abundance trends on Georges Bank, 1977–2004. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 909–919.Interannual trends in Georges Bank zooplankton abundance are described and related to variations in environmental variables for the period 1977–2004. Total zooplankton counts increased to above average levels in 1989 and stayed over or close to average through 2004. This analysis identified a group of taxa including Centropages typicus, Metridia lucens, and Temora longicornis that had similar interannual patterns of abundance. All these taxa increased sharply in the early 1990s and remained high through 2001. Some taxa declined sharply in 2002, others have continued elevated through 2004. Total zooplankton counts in the past two years were also boosted by a substantial increase in the abundance of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Evidence is presented that these changes may be related to variations in Scotian Shelf inflow, which freshened water on the Northeast US continental shelf, perhaps increasing both primary production and the influx of zooplankton into the region. There was a positive correlation between the biomass of pelagic predators and the abundance of several zooplankton taxa, suggesting that bottom-up processes and advective supply are the key factors that regulate the Georges Bank foodweb.},

	abstract = {We investigated regime shifts in seasonal zooplankton communities of the Northeast continental shelf Large Marine Ecosystem (NES) and its subcomponent ecoregions over a multi-decadal period (1977–2013). Our cross ecoregion analysis shows that regime shifts in different ecoregions often exhibited very distinct characteristics, emphasizing more granular fluctuations in NES plankton communities relative to previous work. Shifts early in the time series generally reflected an increase in abundance levels. The response of zooplankton abundance within fall communities was more similar among ecoregions than for spring communities. The Gulf of Maine exhibited highly distinct patterns from other ecoregions, with regime shifts identified in the early 1980s, early 2000s, and mid-2000s for spring communities. Regime shifts were identified in the early to mid-1990s for the NES, Georges Bank, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight ecoregions, while the fall communities experienced shifts in the early 1990s and late 1980s for the NES and Georges Bank, but in the late 1990s in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. A constrained correspondence analysis of zooplankton community against local and basin-scale climatological indices suggests that water temperature, stratification, and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) were the predominant factors in driving the zooplankton community composition.},

Multiyear variability of phytoplankton abundance in the Gulf of Maine. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 1833–1841.Significant interannual changes in phytoplankton abundance were identified in the Continuous Plankton Recorder time-series collected in the Gulf of Maine from 1961 to 2008. Abundance levels of nearly all the common taxa began to increase in 1990 and remained elevated through 2001. During that period, total numbers were above average throughout the year, with an unusual bloom in late summer. Multivariate analysis of abundance identified three consecutive multiyear periods of varying abundance levels: low to average from 1961 to 1989, above average or very high from 1990 to 2001, and below average thereafter, through 2008. Phytoplankton abundance patterns were closely aligned to the rising trends displayed by several of the common zooplankton taxa. The North Atlantic Oscillation was the only environmental variable examined that showed some association with time-series abundance trends of plankton. The index was primarily positive in the 1990s, which would favour the propagation of warm, nutrient-rich slope water into the region. Perhaps the increased influx of this water, along with feedback enrichment from abundant zooplankton stocks and reduced top-down control by the relative scarcity of the dominant copepod Calanus finmarchicus, combined with a low salinity to make the 1990s a unique decade for plankton change in the Gulf of Maine.},

	abstract = {Since 1961, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center of the National Marine Fisheries Service has been conducting a study of the zooplankton of the US Northeast Shelf ecosystem. One of the objectives is to investigate ecological patterns of the system for any evidence of regime shifts and their effects on biodiversity and abundance of zooplankton and fish stocks. Two sampling strategies have been used: collections with Continuous Plankton Recorders beginning in 1961; and collections with bongo nets during the decade of MARMAP surveys (1977–1987), augmented by a time series of collections made during the autumn and spring groundfish surveys (1977–1993). The climate regime of the region leads to distinct and recurring seasonal pulses in zooplankton biomass and species succession in each of the four subareas of the shelf ecosystem distinguished. Evidence was detected in the analyses of inter-annual variability in species abundance and zooplankton biomass. However, no evidence of a large-scale regime shift of the magnitude described recently for other areas was detected from our analyses. Species shifts in abundance and the inter-annual and decadal variability observed in zooplankton biomass levels have allowed for sufficient residual sustainability in zooplankton biodiversity and abundance to support the recovery of depleted pelagic fish stocks.},
