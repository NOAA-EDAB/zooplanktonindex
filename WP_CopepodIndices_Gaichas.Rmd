# Introduction

The Atlantic herring research track working group (WG) is interested in exploring impacts of food availability on herring stock dynamics. Indices of zooplankton abundance were proposed for exploration. 

These indices could potentially explain:

1.  herring recruitment 
1.  herring growth/condition 
1.  patterns in herring "survival" random effects  

The WG decided to focus on patterns in recruitment, as low recruitment in recent years is an important issue for the stock and for fishery management.

The WG used a boosted regression tree analysis (Molina 2024) to identify zooplankton indices that best explained patterns in herring recruitment.  These indices included large copepods in spring (influencing growth of herring postlarvae and juveniles), and small copeopods in fall (influencing survival of herring larvae over the winter).

In this working paper, we develop indices of large copepods in spring and small copepods in fall using zooplankton survey data (citation) from 1982-2022. We tailor the indices to the spatial footprint of the Atlantic herring stock assessment, and further use information on the changing spatial distribution of herring larvae over time from the same dataset to evaluate potential changes in availability of small copepods to herring larvae. 


# Methods

We used spatio-temporal modeling to develop zooplankton indices using the ECOMON data as an input.  

Decisions:

1.  zooplankton species
2.  which zooplankton metric (area or volume)
3.  spatial footprint
4.  temporal scale (seasonal? annual?)
5.  potential covariates

## Zooplankton species

We use herring diet information to determine which zooplankton species to include. This information is from both literature and food habits data. 

"The herring is a plankton feeder.... Examination of 1,500 stomachs showed that adult herring near Eastport were living solely on copepods and on pelagic euphausiid shrimps (*Meganyctiphanes norwegica*), fish less than 4 inches long depending on the former alone, while the larger herring were eating both. When first hatched, and before the disappearance of the yolk sac, the larvae (European) feed on larval snails and crustaceans, on diatoms, and on peridinians, but they soon begin taking copepods, and depend exclusively on these for a time after they get to be 12 mm. long, especially on the little Pseudocalanus elongatus. As they grow older they feed more and more on the larger copepods and amphipods, pelagic shrimps, and decapod crustacean larvae [@collette_bigelow_2002]."

What herring eat from NEFSC food habits data is summarized here:  https://fwdp.shinyapps.io/tm2020/
Copepods are highest diet proportion, followed by well digested prey (AR), and euphausiids. Broken down by decade and season, it is clear that copeopods dominate adult diets in winter and spring, and more so recently. 

Maybe copeopods are bad for hering??

Our focus in developing the indices is on herring recruitment, so we prioritize indices of food for larvae through juveniles.

Models developed for the Herring RT are for the following copepod categories:

*   Large copepods ALL:  *Calanus finmarchicus*,  *Metridia lucens*, *Calanus minor*,  *Eucalanus* spp.,  *Calanus* spp.

*   Small copepods ALL:  *Centropages typicus*, *Pseudocalanus* spp., *Temora longicornis*, *Centropages hamatus*, *Paracalanus parvus*, *Acartia* spp., *Clausocalanus arcuicornis*, *Acartia longiremis*, *Clausocalanus furcatus*,  *Temora stylifera*, *Temora* spp., *Tortanus discaudatus*, *Paracalanus* spp.

These categories included all life stages of each copepod species.

(Models were also developed for *Calanus finmarchicus* alone, total zooplankton volume, and Euphausiids, which may be useful for comparison with adult Atlantic herring condition or growth in the future.)

An additional model was developed for Atlantic herring larvae using the same dataset in order to characterize the spatial extent of herring larvae compared with their zooplankton prey. This model was not used as an index due to missing data during several years of the time series.

## Zooplankton metric

Previous zooplankton indices use the numbers per 100 cubic meters of filtered water volume `_100m3` data [@kane_zooplankton_2007 ; @morse_distinct_2017]. Other current analyses use the numbers per 100 cubic meters as well. 

## Spatial scale

NEFSC survey strata definitions are built into the VAST `northwest-atlantic` extrapolation grid already. Therefore, fall and spring survey strata sets used in the Atlantic herring assessment were also applied to the zooplankton indices. Indices were also calculated in Ecological Production Units (EPUs) used in regional ecosystem reporting (Fig. \ref{fig:maps}).

## Temporal scale

Options explored for temporal scale included:

1.  An annual model mixes many generations of zooplankton; "all" is months 1-12
1.  Splitting the year into two seasons, rolling winter into spring and summer into fall is done for multiple fish species
    *  "SPRING" months 1-6
    *  "FALL" months 7-12
1.  Splitting the year into 4 seasons, 2 matching survey seasons (spring/fall) and try two for winter and summer to cover other portions of herring life history. Current designations are
    *  "winter" months 12, 1, 2
    *  "spring" months 3, 4, 5
    *  "summer" months 6, 7, 8
    *  "fall" months 9, 10, 11
1.  Finally, timing of herring larvae in the system was derived from the herring larvae data
    *  "sepfeb" months 9-12 and 1-2 of the following year
    *  "nolarv" months 3-8


Testing models with data split over 4 seasons for 1982-2022 resulted in poor model performance, inability to estimate parameters, and lack of convergence for cases where parameters could be estimated. Therefore, we used the SPRING = January-June and FALL = July-December temporal scale as a starting point. 

## Spatio-temporal modeling

We applied the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) model [@thorson_comparing_2017; @thorson_guidance_2019] to estimate zooplankton indices from zooplankton survey data. 

VAST is a Geostatistical generalized linear mixed effects model (GLMM) that models two linear predictors for an index: 1. encounter rate,  and 2. positive catch (amount in stomach)

A full model for the first linear predictor $\rho_1$ for each observation $i$ can include:
*  fixed intercepts $\beta_1$ for each category $c$ and time $t$, 
*  spatial random effects $\omega_1$ for each location $s$ and category, 
*  spatio-temporal random effects $\varepsilon_1$ for each location, category, and time, 
*  fixed vessel effects $\eta_1$ by vessel $v$ and category, and 
*  fixed catchability impacts $\lambda_1$ of covariates $Q$ for each observation and variable $k$: 

$$\rho_1(i) = \beta_1(c_i, t_i) + \omega_1^*(s_i, c_i) + \varepsilon_1^*(s_i, c_i, t_i) + \eta_1(v_i, c_i) + \sum_{k=1}^{n_k} \lambda_1(k) Q(i,k)$$ 

The full model for the second linear predictor $\rho_2$ has the same structure, estimating $\beta_2$, $\omega_2$, $\varepsilon_2$, $\eta_2$, and $\lambda_2$ using the observations, categories, locations, times, and covariates. 

VAST model code and documentation is available here: https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST 

Spatial and spatio-temporal correlation decay with increasing distance estimated as $\kappa$ in a Matern function with fixed smoothness and geometric anisotropy (directional correlation, optionally estimated by the model). 

Initial model selection consistently supported the inclusion of spatial and spatio-temporal random effects and anisotropy across all datasets: fall, spring, and annual. 

Observations in space are used to define fixed locations ("knots") covering the full extent of the model. We assume constant variation within a timestep at a knot. 

Modelers specify the number of knots to group observation locations, to balance computation time and resolution. We used 500 knots (Fig. \ref{fig:knots}).

```{r knots}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("pyindex/lgcopeALL_spring_500_biascorrect_doy/Data_and_knots.png"))
```

Observations correlated in space and in space over time due to unmeasured processes are modeled as multivariate normal Gaussian Random Fields (GRF):

$\omega_1$ ~ MVN(0, $\mathbf R_1$); $\omega_2$ ~ MVN(0, $\mathbf R_2$)   
$\varepsilon_1$(,t) ~ MVN(0, $\mathbf R_1$); $\varepsilon_2$(,t) ~ MVN(0, $\mathbf R_2$) 

Spatial and spatio-temporal correlation decay with increasing distance $\mathbf d$ estimated as $\kappa$ in a Mat&eacute;rn function with fixed smoothness $\nu$ and geometric anisotropy $H$ (directional correlation). 
  
Correlation function between locations $s$ and $s'$:

$$\mathbf R_1(s, s') = \frac{1}{2^{\nu-1}\Gamma(\nu)} \times (\kappa_1 \lvert \mathbf d(s,s') \mathbf H  \rvert)^\nu \times K_\nu (\kappa_1 \lvert \mathbf d(s,s') \mathbf H  \rvert)$$

Estimation uses stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approximation.

Observation model "Index2", Gamma distribution for positive catches and Alternative "Poisson-link delta-model" using log-link for numbers-density and log-link for biomass per number. It is intended for continuous data, which includes biomass data and “numbers standardized to a fixed area.”

Probability of encounter Poisson: $p(i) = 1 - exp[-n(i)]$ *set to 1 for groups found at all stations, e.g. small copepods or zooplankton volume*

Number of zooplankton cells per volume given encounter: $r(i) = \frac{n(i)}{p(i)}w(i)$

Probability for numbers per volume $B$ where $g$ is a Gamma function.  :

$$ Pr[b(i) = B] =  \begin{cases} 1-p(i), B = 0\\\\p(i) \times g[B|r(i), \sigma_b^2], B > 0 \end{cases},$$  

We are interpreting zooplankton abundance per 100 cubic meters as numbers standardized to a fixed area (volume) in applying the Gamma observation model.

Density $b$ at a location (knot) $s$ for year $t$ is then the predicted number of cells per volume (linear predictor for encounter * linear predictor for cells/vol given encounter):

$$\hat{b}_{s,t} = \hat{n}_{s,t}\hat{w}_{s,t}$$

Index based on area $a$ weighting for each of 500 knots (or subsets): 

$$I_t = \sum_{s=1}^{500} a_s\hat{b}_{s,t}$$

For final models, bias correction was done as in @thorson_implementing_2016.

## Model validation

Zooplankton indices have not previously been developed using spatio-temporal modeling in the Northeast US. Therefore, we compare previously estimated annual abundance anomalies for *Calanus finmarchicus* with annual anomalies estimated from our VAST models. These anomalies are estimated at the ecoregion (Mid Atlantic Bight--MAB, Georges Bank--GB, and Gulf of Maine--GOM) scale. 

## Model selection

Model selection was done in two stages, the first looking at spatial, spatio-temporal random effects and the second looking at covariates.  The model selection script is available at 
https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/zooplanktonindex/blob/main/VASTscripts/VASTunivariate_zoopindex_modselection.R

Models were run using REML and without bias correction for model selection. 

Two different observation models were applied. The default VAST index standardization (`purpose = "index2"` in `make_settings`) uses a Gamma distribution for positive catches and an alternative "Poisson-link delta-model" using log-link for numbers-density and log-link for biomass per number (`ObsModel= c(2,1)`).

We applied the default observation model to *Calanus finmarchicus* (calfin_100m3) and Large copepods (calfin_100m3 + mlucens_100m3 + calminor_100m3 + euc_100m3 + calspp_100m3) datasets.

The default was used for index standardization of stomach contents data for pelagic and benthic forage indices. It is intended for continuous data, which includes biomass data and "numbers standardized to a fixed area" (see section starting at line 239 in the VAST user manual [here](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/VAST/blob/main/manual/VAST_model_structure.pdf). I am interpreting zooplankton abundance per 100 cubic meters as numbers standardized to a fixed area (volume) in applying the Gamma observation model.

For data where there are some years where the species is present in all (or 0) samples, estimating the probability of encounter fails (or at least, VAST won't let you try). In these cases, the options are to treat intercepts representing temporal variability as random effects (by setting `RhoConfig` `Beta` or `Epsilon` entries to something other than 0), or to use a different link function. 

We intend for our indices to potentially be used in assessment (though as a covariate rather than an index, so maybe I'm being too strict), so the recommendation is to "minimize covariance in the estimated index by excluding any temporal correlation on model components (i.e., the intercept is a fixed effect in each year, and the spatio-temporal term is independent in each year)" [@thorson_guidance_2019]. 

All of the small copepods datasets had at least one year where our small copepods groupings were encountered at all stations. None had years with 0 encounters. 

Therefore, we used a different link function, the Poisson-link fixing encounter probability=1 for any year where all samples encounter the species. We kept all other settings for index standardization the same, but set (`ObsModel= c(2,4)`).

The only "catchability" covariates tested were Day of Year ("doy") to compensate for the fast turnover rate of zooplankton during the season.  

Converged models with the lowest AIC for each taxonomic/season combination were considered best.

## Model diagnostics

After selecting the converged model structures with the most support based on AIC, standard diagnostics were evaluated for each model: data available by season, year, and in space, quantile residuals in aggregate and in space. Model results include the ln density each year and the resulting indices for each spatial unit.

## Defining herring larval presence in time and space

When developing a zooplankton index, it is important to determine whether the zooplankton are available to herring larvae in time and space. We used data available on herring larvae in the zooplankton dataset to define the most likely time and space for herring larvae, and used those temporal and spatial definitions to further refine selected zooplankton indices.

A herring larvae VAST model was developed using the same methods as above, and resulting indices were compared with those estimated by @richardson_development_2010. 

Models were initially developed using the same seasons as for zooplankton (Spring = January-June, Fall = July-December). However, nearly all observations of herring larvae in the 1982-2022 dataset were from September - February (also reflected in the index developed in @richardson_development_2010.) Therefore, another model for September-February was developed, which aligned observations in January-February with those from the preceeding fall September-December. 

To define areas with the most dense herring larvae, we calculate quantiles of density in space across the time series. First we sum the density in each cells over all years, then calculate the quantiles of summed log density from the September-February herring larvae VAST model.

Mapping the quantiles from 60% (white) to 80% (light blue).

Quantiles below 70% include densities south of Long Island and off Cape Hatteras. The WG thinks the larvae found to the south may be lost to the population so we likely don't want to use a quantile below the 70th percentile.

The 80th percentile starts to show a gap on Georges Bank and along the southwest coast of Maine. This may be slicing things too finely to cover general herring larval habitat. 

I think this leaves us with using either the 70th (light green) or 75th (dark green) percentile of summed density over all years to define herring larvae relevant habitat for the small copepods index.

We selected the 70th percentile as the largest that did not include areas in the southern portion of the range to define the "herring larval area" for use in other zooplankton VAST models.

To make a new extrapolation grid using herring larval density 70th percentile, we first make the 70th percentile+ points into an `sf` object by outlining the "concave hull" of the area, then intersect that object with the built in `FishStatsUtils::northwest_atlantic_grid`. 

Next, we define new strata based on that intersection and make a new extrapolation grid. Then we can use this grid and call the new strata as strata.limits when running the small copepods model.

See the full process here: https://noaa-edab.github.io/zooplanktonindex/HerringLarvaeExplore.html 

Using the new grid, run the smallcopeALL_sepfeb dataset in VAST to get an index in the herring larvae area as well as in the others. 

Script for doing this is https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/zooplanktonindex/blob/main/VASTscripts/VASTunivariate_zoopindex_smcopeALL_herrlarvarea.R

### Zooplankton stations by season



### Herring larvae stations by season

Fall sampling for herring larvae was completed in most years aside from GLOBEC. In our definition of spring, herring larvae primarily occur in January and February. We now include a shifted season to better match larval herring availability throughout the time series: September - February. Year corresponds to September-December, and the following January and February are aligned with the previous year (hatch year) in these analyses. Data were missing for

Models compared using REML are identified by model name ("modname" in Table Sb\@ref(tab:modsel1)) which always includes all prey aggregated, season ("all" for annual models of months 1-12, "fall" for models of months 7-12, and "spring" for models of months 1-6), number of knots (500 for all models), and which fixed and random spatial and spatio-temporal effects were included in which linear predictor (1 or 2). The names for model options and associated VAST model settings are:

Model selection 1 (spatial, spatio-temporal effects, no covariates) options (following @ng_predator_2021) and naming:
*  All models set Use_REML = TRUE in fit_model specifications.  
*  Modeled effects, model name suffix, and VAST settings by model:  

1.  "_alleffectson" = Spatial and spatio-temporal random effects plus anisotropy in both linear predictors; FieldConfig default (all IID)
1.  "_noaniso" = Spatial and spatio-temporal random effects in both linear predictors with anisotopy turned off; FieldConfig default (all IID) and `use_anisotopy = FALSE`
1.  "_noomeps2" = Spatial and spatio-temporal random effects plus anisotropy only in linear predictor 1;   FieldConfig = 0 for Omega2, Epsilon2
1.  "_noomeps2_noaniso" = Spatial and spatio-temporal random effects only in linear predictor 1 with anisotopy turned off;  FieldConfig = 0 for Omega2, Epsilon2 and `use_anisotopy = FALSE`
1. "_noomeps2_noeps1" =  Spatial random effects plus anisotropy only in linear predictor 1;   FieldConfig = 0 for Omega2, Epsilon2, Epsilon1
1.  "_noomeps2_noeps1_noaniso" = Spatial random effects only in linear predictor 1 with anisotopy turned off;   FieldConfig = 0 for Omega2, Epsilon2, Epsilon1 and `use_anisotopy = FALSE`
1.  "_noomeps12" = Anisotropy, but no spatial or spatio-temporal random effects in either linear predictor;   FieldConfig = 0 for both Omega, Epsilon 
1.  "_noomeps12_noaniso" = No spatial or spatio-temporal random effects in either linear predictor;  FieldConfig = 0 for both Omega, Epsilon  and `use_anisotopy = FALSE`

Using REML, models including spatial and spatio-temporal random effects as well as anisotropy were best supported by the data. This was true for the spring dataset and the fall dataset for calfin, lgcopeALL, smallcopeALL, and smallcopeSOE. 

Full outputs from stage 1 model selection are posted to google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1szQzBbn-bQosPK4AqKRbfbduGGMM-BDG?usp=drive_link). 

Including the day of year covariate had mixed success. While some models fit better with this covariate, others did not meet the convergence criteria. Therefore, we moved forward with the best fitting model that converged to generate indices.
